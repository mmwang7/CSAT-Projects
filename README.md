# CSAT-Projects
Projects I created during my Computer Science: Advanced Topics class my senior year of high school. These project ideas were based on my own personal interests.

## Projects Overview (Based on start date):
1. Cube Art (Java) - Took an image as input and converted it to colors on a rubiks cube and created a pdf with the cube faces need to make the image using an inputed number of cubes.
2. Motion Detection (Python) - Using a Raspberry Pi and camera, when motion was detected by the camera, an email would be sent to the user to notify them of the motion.
3. Movie Recommendation (Python) - Developed alogrithm to recommend 10 movies/shows related to a show/movie the user just watched.
